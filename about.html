    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm learning how to build websites from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This page is my playground for experimenting with web development concepts.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I started with a blank HTML file and have been adding features one by one -- a navigation bar, images, lists, a footer, and now multiple pages. Every small step builds toward something bigger.</p>

    <h2>What I Enjoy</h2>
    <p>The best part about web development is seeing changes instantly. You edit a line of code, save the file, and the browser updates right away. That fast feedback loop makes learning fun.</p>

    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    <p>I plan to keep building on this site, adding more pages, learning CSS layout techniques like flexbox and grid, and eventually diving into JavaScript frameworks.</p>
