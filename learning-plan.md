# Web Developer Learning Plan

## What I've learned so far
- HTML structure
- CSS styling
- Basic JavaScript
- Multi-page sites
- Git & GitHub

## What to learn next (in order)

### 1. CSS Layout
Flexbox and CSS Grid. These are used everywhere for positioning elements on a page. Practice by rebuilding layouts you see on real websites.

### 2. Responsive Design
Making sites work on phones, tablets, and desktops using media queries. Almost every job requires this.

### 3. JavaScript (deeper)
Variables, functions, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, events, fetch API for loading data. This is the biggest skill gap between beginners and hirable developers.

### 4. React
The most in-demand frontend framework. Once your JavaScript is solid, learn React. Most job listings ask for it.

### 5. Build projects
A portfolio of 3-5 projects matters more than certificates. Ideas: a to-do app, a weather app using an API, a personal portfolio site.

## What makes you hirable
- A GitHub profile with real projects
- A portfolio website showcasing your work
- Being able to rebuild a design from a mockup/screenshot
- Understanding how to read documentation and figure things out

## Free resources
- MDN Web Docs
- freeCodeCamp
- The Odin Project
