# Web Developer Learning Plan

## Completed
- HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, semantic elements)
- CSS styling (colors, fonts, spacing, borders, pseudo-elements, shared stylesheets)
- CSS Layout (flexbox, grid, calc(), fr units)
- Responsive Design (media queries, breakpoints, device testing)
- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, DOM manipulation, event listeners, arrays, loops, conditionals, fetch API)
- Multi-page sites
- Git & GitHub

## Up next

### 1. JavaScript (remaining concepts)
- localStorage - save data that persists after page refresh
- Form handling - reading inputs, validation, preventing default behavior
- Array methods - `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.find()` (used constantly in React)

### 2. React
The most in-demand frontend framework. Builds directly on everything learned so far. HTML becomes JSX, CSS works the same, JavaScript is the core.

### 3. Build projects
A portfolio of 3-5 projects matters more than certificates. Ideas: a to-do app, a weather app using an API, a personal portfolio site.

## What makes you hirable
- A GitHub profile with real projects
- A portfolio website showcasing your work
- Being able to rebuild a design from a mockup/screenshot
- Understanding how to read documentation and figure things out
